# Clouds on Mars Color Scheme for Vim

Clouds on Mars is based on a textmate theme of the same name originally
created by designer [Will Flagello](https://twitter.com/flvgello).

I highly recommend using the font
[Inconsolata](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) for
both your macvim/gvim and terminal font.

256-Color terminals are also supported, though there are some
differences with the Gui version.
